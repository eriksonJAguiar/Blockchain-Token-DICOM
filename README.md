# Blockchain-Token-DICOM
A Hyperledger fabric and python3 project for tracking medical imaging sharing between researchers

### Blockchain network

The blockchain network built with Hyperledger Fabric 1.4.8 is describes on [Folder Network](https://github.com/eriksonJAguiar/Blockchain-Token-DICOM/tree/master/hyperledger-network)

### Tracking token module

For generate the token hash, such as insert in medical imaging, we develop a python cliente and server to exchange data on network, represented by [Folder tracking](https://github.com/eriksonJAguiar/Blockchain-Token-DICOM/tree/master/tracking-token)
